# Blood Pressure Estimation from Video

This project estimates blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) from video footage of a finger illuminated by a torchlight. It processes the video to analyze red intensity changes, extracts features using CNN-LSTM models, and predicts blood pressure using a trained model.

## Features

1. **Extract Red Intensity**: Analyze the red channel intensity across video frames.
2. **Preprocess Signal**: Detrend and filter the signal using bandpass filtering.
3. **Heart Rate Extraction**: Calculate beats per minute (BPM) using signal peaks.
4. **CNN-LSTM Prediction**:
   - **CNN**: Extract spatial features from video frames.
   - **LSTM**: Capture temporal dependencies across frames.
5. **BP Estimation**: Predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure using BPM as an additional feature.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- SciPy
- PyTorch
- Tkinter

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LordConnoisseur/Non-Invasive-Estimation-of-Health-Parameters.git
    cd ./Non-Invasive-Estimation-of-Health-Parameters
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```sh
    python3 blood_pressure.py
    ```

2. Select a video file for analysis using the GUI window that appears.

3. The script will:
   - Extract BPM from the video.
   - Use a trained model (`bp_model_lstm.pth`) to predict blood pressure values.
   - Display the predicted systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

## Example Output

After selecting a video file, the program will display:
```
Predicted Systolic: 120.45, Diastolic: 80.67
```

## Limitations

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure the video has stable and visible red intensity variations.
2. **Model Generalization**: Trained models may require retraining for different lighting conditions or populations.
